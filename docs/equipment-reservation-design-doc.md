#Stories

Stories 1, 2 and 3 are tied for most importance, 4 and 5 are second most important, and 6 is least important that is still necessary for minimum viability. Story 7 is not necessary but would be good to complete if there is time.
Story 1: As Silas Student, I would like to see a list of available equipment during the period that I want to check something out, so that I can make a decision on what to check out.
Story 2: As Silas Student, I would like to request a checkout so that I can go in-person to pick it up.
Story 3: As Abraham Ambassador, I would like to complete a checkout when given a pid, so that students can actually check out the equipment they requested.
Story 4: As Abraham Ambassador, I would like to check a piece of equipment back in using a student's pid, so that someone else can check it out.
Story 5: As Remington Root, I would like to add new pieces of equipment to the list of available equipment so that students have more options of what to check out.
Story 6: As Silas Student, I would like to sign a usage and liability agreement before my first checkout so that there is proof that I know what the consequences are if I break or lose the equipment.
Story 7: As Abraham Ambassador, I would like to send notifications for equipment that is due in 1 day, 0 days, or overdue so that it can be returned promptly for other students to use.
not doable this semester but would be important once there is a group feature: As Leonardo CAD Leader, I would like to have the functionalities of stories 1, 2, and 6 for organizations so that I can check out enough equipment for my club to use at a meeting/workshop/whatever.
