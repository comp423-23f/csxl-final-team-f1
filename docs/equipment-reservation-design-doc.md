# Overview:

The XL has equipment, and will be getting more, that it would like to open up for students to reserve for varying lengths of time during the week or over the weekend.

# Key Personas:

The key personas of the equipment reservation system will be Student, Ambassador, and Admin.

The Student needs an easy-to-understand interface that will allow them to navigate to an equipment reservation page. They also need to be able to see which equipment is available and which is not, be able to sign a liability waiver the first time they reserve equipment, and confirm a request to reserve equipment so that an Ambassador can finalize the process.

The Ambassador needs an interface to confirm reservation requests, confirm student liability forms, and finalize reservation requests for Students so that they can retrieve the equipment for the Student to borrow. They also need an interface to check equipment back into the list of available equipment.

The Admin needs an interface to add new equipment to the list of reservable equipment. In the case that a piece of equipment needs repair/is broken, the Admin will also need a way to remove equipment from the list of reservable equipment in that interface.
