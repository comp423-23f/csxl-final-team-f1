#4 Wireframes/Mockups
Here is the link to my Figma table: https://www.figma.com/file/zJ77A1AsEg5nkFpFpa6gAf/XL-Coworking-Application-(Copy)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=UIr4rs8335pieLlM-1

I made the views based of the 3 types of people; students, ambassadors, and admin.

Student View:
I made it so that for the Student View, the student can only see if the equipment is available, unavailble, or disabled. This is because I don't want the student to be able to check out equipment themselves. I'd rather have an ambassador check out an equipment for the student.

Ambassdador View:
For Ambassador View, I made it so that ambassadors can click on the boxes and see more in-depth about the equipment. When they click on an unavailable equipment, they can see the PID, email, liability agreement, checkout date, and return date for that specific equipment. I also added the SN number of the equipment in case they try to give back a different Oculus. The ambassador will be the one to click "Item Returned" for that equipment once a student returns it.

When they click on available equipment, they can click on the "Checkout Date" and "Return Date" box to change it based on how long the student want the equipment. Ambassadors would let the students read the Liability Agreement where they would have to digitally sign it, input their PID and their email. Once the everything has been checked, the ambassador will click "Confirm" to confirm everything is right and that the student agreed to the Liability Agreement.

Admin View:
Admin has the same power and views with the ambassadors except they also get access to the "Disable Equipment" and "Add New Equipment" buttons. The "Disable Equipment" once clicked will allow them to disable any equipment they want. This is useful in case something is broken or needs repairs. Once you press the "Add New Equipment" button, plus buttons will appear next to existing equipment, and pressing that will allow you to add another of that equipment. There is also a "New Item" section at the bottom which you can change the name to whatever you want, and a plus button is also there to let you add it to the website.
